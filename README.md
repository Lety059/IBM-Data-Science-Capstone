# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone
Final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
This repository contains the final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of successful rocket landings using the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data. By analyzing historical data, we can predict whether a launch will result in a successful recovery.

## Key Learnings

Throughout the course, I have learned how to:
- Work with APIs and web scraping for data collection
- Clean and wrangle data efficiently
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Develop predictive models using machine learning
- Visualize results and communicate findings

## Project Phases

1. **Data Collection**: Collecting data using the SpaceX API and web scraping from Wikipedia.
2. **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and preprocessing the data to make it ready for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying key insights using visualizations and statistics.
4. **Modeling**: Developing machine learning models to predict the outcome of rocket landings.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance and optimizing it for better accuracy.

## Conclusion

This capstone project has provided a comprehensive understanding of how data science can be used to solve real-world problems. The results obtained from the model predictions will help SpaceX improve its launch success rates.

good job to everyone!
